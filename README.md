# Covinfo
Our Project is a one stop for getting all the information about the Ongoing Pandemic COVID-19. We have made a made a minimalistic User Interface with
many the features like: 

1. Latest Notifications and Updates
2. Total Number of beds and hospitals in rural and urban areas with state wise analysis.
3. Included the Statistics in the form of charts to provide user, the ease of visualizing the relevant data.
4. Helpline number for each of the states.

We have fetched the APIs and printed the data in a sortable format giving the
user to filter according to his need and further we have also trained the provided data to predict the missing values in it and then plotted the final comparison
graph.
